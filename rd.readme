Library Membership Issuance System Specification: 

You are required to model a library membership issuance system in UPPAAL based on the following specifications.

Every time the user wants to issue a book or buy a membership, s/he should sign in to the system using their email ID.

For each sign-in, the system should authenticate the details. In case the authentication fails, users have to check their credentials and sign in again.

On signing-in, the user has two options:

Buy a membership card

View membership details/history

The membership card is of 2 types: Gold and Platinum, with different rates. Users can only purchase one type of membership at a time (in one transaction).

If the membership card is bought, the payment should be made before exiting the system. There is only one mode of payment i.e. via Credit/Debit card.

Users should log out of the system after every transaction.

You have to additionally model the payment system from the bankâ€™s point of view. The transaction will only be approved by the bank if there is sufficient balance in the account.

Additionally, verify any 2 safety and liveness properties each on this template using UPPAAL. Clearly state those properties in your submission.
